# Coding Projects Repository

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains all my coding projects, practice exercises, and revision work as I continue my journey from **basic web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** to **React and beyond**.

## 📂 Project Categories
- **HTML & CSS Projects** → layouts, portfolios, static pages  
- **JavaScript Projects** → mini-apps, DOM manipulation, interactive widgets  
- **React Projects** → components, state management, full applications  
- **Other Experiments** → anything else I build while learning and revising  

## 🚀 Goals
- Strengthen my fundamentals in frontend development  
- Build hands-on projects to apply what I learn  
- Keep all coding work in a single, organized place  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML5, CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- React.js  
- Git & GitHub

✨ This repo will be continuously updated as I build more projects. Stay tuned!
